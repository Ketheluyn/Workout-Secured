- `AuthService.java`: Provides authentication logic.

## Unit Testing

Unit tests are implemented in `AuthServiceTest.java` using JUnit:
- Tests for successful and failed login scenarios.

## Documentation

- Inline comments and docstrings are used for all classes and methods.
- External documentation is provided in this `README.md` file.

## Running the Project

1. Run `Main.java` to start the application.
2. Execute `AuthServiceTest.java` to run the unit tests.
